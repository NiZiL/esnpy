# esnpy

An out-of-the-box librairy for Echo State Network experimentations.  
Based on *The "echo state" approach to analysing and training recurrent neural networks* by Herbert Jaeger and *A pratical guide to applying Echo State Networks* by Mantas Lukosevicius.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiZiL/esnpy
[sudo] python setup.py install
```

## About the documentation

Sorry guys, I'm not into writing documentation...
But please, feel free to open ticket and discuss about your trouble using `esnpy`, I'll enjoy to help you !

Anyway, you can take a look at the `examples` folder for a quick start ;)

## Future work

* Reservoir tuning with intrisic plasticity  
⋅⋅* *Improving reservoirs using intrinsic plasticity*, B. Schrauwen et al.  
⋅⋅* *Online reservoir adaptation by intrinsic plasticity* for backpropagation–decorrelation and echo state learning*, J.J. Steil  

* Online training  
⋅⋅* *Backpropagation-decorrelation: online recurrent learning with O(N) complexity*, J.J. Steil
